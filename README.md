# Analysing-App-Store-Data
I just realised I have *36* mobile applications installed on my 64GB phone and a couple of questions ran in my mind: 
- When did I download all these apps and how many of them do I actually use? (- Is this healthy? )
- Is this the same case as everyone else
- What attracts me to download, use, buy and rate an App on the Appstore?
- Are my favorite apps the favorites of other people? 
- If not, are there any interesting sites that I am missing on?
- What are some of the most succesful apps in the world apart from the mainstream ones we know (facebook, tinder, messenger, whatsapp, instagram, linkedin)?
- Having a look at my phone's screen time analytics makes me realise that my most used apps are: Social networking, Productivity, Creativity. Is gaming thriving without me? ðŸ¤£

These and many other questions made me realise that the App store dataset is probably a dataset I would genuinely have fun exploring and getting some discoveries out of the way. With this, I went to Kaggle for some datasets and inspiration and found this: https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps/data

# Possible questions: 
1. How does the App details contribute the user ratings?
2. Try to compare app statistics for different groups?
